# Agent Output Surface

Every packaged anti-slop tool reviewed for this vault operates on documents. An
agent's own conversational output is not a document, it is a transcript, and it
is the surface where most people now meet slop most often: the reply that opens
by praising the question, restates the request, announces a plan, and closes
with a summary of what was just said. No prior art in this domain covers it.

## What counts as this surface

In scope: the agent's chat replies, its status narration between tool calls, its
progress claims, its summaries of its own work, and the framing text wrapped
around tool results.

Out of scope, because they have their own notes: code the agent writes
([[Code Surface]]), commit messages and pull request bodies
([[Commit and Review Surface]]), documentation it produces
([[Documentation Surface]]), and notes it files into a vault
([[Knowledge Base Surface]]).

The distinction matters because this surface has a property the others lack:
**the reader is present while it is produced**, and the cost of padding is paid
in the reader's attention immediately rather than in a future maintainer's. A
padded function comment wastes someone's time next year. A padded agent reply
wastes it now, in a loop, dozens of times a session.

## Behaviour map

Each row names the behaviour, where it shows up, its tier under
[[Evidence Tiers]], the procedure that has to convict before anything is
changed, and the innocent case that stops the row from being a blanket rule.

| Behaviour | Where it appears | Tier | Procedure that convicts | Innocent case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sycophantic opener | first sentence of a reply | 1 | [[The Deletion Test]] on the sentence | a genuine correction the user made, acknowledged once |
| Affirming both sides of a real choice | recommendation replies | 1 | [[The Inversion Test]] on the recommendation | a question where the tradeoff genuinely turns on user preference |
| Request restatement | opening paragraph | 1 | [[The Deletion Test]] | ambiguous request being disambiguated before work starts |
| Plan narration for a one-step task | before the first tool call | 1 | delete it; did the reader lose anything | multi-step work where the plan is the deliverable |
| Terminal summary repeating the body | last section of a reply | 1 | [[The Deletion Test]] on the section | long output where the summary is the only skimmable part |
| Over-structuring | headings and bullets on a two-paragraph answer | 2 | [[The Deletion Test]] on the scaffolding | reference material genuinely used for lookup |
| Hedging on a checkable fact | anywhere | 1 | check the fact; the hedge dies or the claim does | a genuinely uncertain quantity, hedged once and quantified |
| Premature progress claim | status narration | Layer 0 | re-run the check that would prove it | a claim explicitly scoped as partial |
| False completion claim | closing summary | Layer 0 | re-run the tests, the build, the scanner | none; this is a hard failure |
| Unverified tool-result restatement | after a tool call | 1 | read the raw result and diff it against the summary | faithful compression of a long output |
| Enthusiasm about the agent's own output | closing lines | 2 | [[The Deletion Test]] | none in technical work; treat as routing only |
| Apology loop after a correction | successive replies | 2 | delete all but the first acknowledgement | a first apology, once |

The two Layer 0 rows behave differently from everything above them, in the same
way the hallucinated-import row does on [[Code Surface]]. "The tests pass" is
decidable: run them. A progress claim is not a style question and does not route
to a structural procedure, it routes to the check that would falsify it. Those
rows are allowed to hard-fail.

## Why sycophancy is the anchor behaviour

The rest of the table is largely reasoned. This row is measured, and it carries
the others.

`cheng-elephant-sycophancy`, peer reviewed in Science, found that models
preserve user face **45 percentage points more than humans do** and **affirm
both sides in 48 percent of moral conflicts**. The second figure is the one that
belongs to this surface, because affirming both sides of a decision the user
asked you to help make is a refusal to do the work, delivered in a register that
reads as balance.

`anthropic-sycophancy-study` puts a production-scale number on the same
behaviour, at **9 percent of guidance conversations overall**, **25 percent for
relationships** and **38 percent for spirituality**, across roughly **639,000
conversations**, with **Opus 4.7 at roughly half the rate of Opus 4.6**. It is
first-party vendor research about the vendor's own models and is flagged as such
here and in [[Sycophancy Evidence]].

`wu-verbal-tics` cannot currently support an operational claim. Its arXiv
abstract metadata and rendered v3 paper name different model cohorts. The
rendered paper contains per-model indices and a small human evaluation, but the
ledger blocks both until arXiv serves a consistent version. Its named tics,
including "That's a great question" and "It's important to note", remain useful
search strings rather than validated per-model rankings.

One more result shapes the over-structuring row. `soumik-judging-the-judges`
reports judge style bias ranging from **0.10 to 0.76**, with **markdown
preferred over plain text**, against position bias of 0.04 or less. If the
evaluator prefers formatting, then formatting is what gets optimised, and an
agent trained under such judges will produce headings whether or not the content
warrants them. Over-structuring is therefore a predicted defect, not an
incidental one.

## The check that cannot be delegated to the model

Asking the agent to review its own transcript for these behaviours is the
obvious move and it is barred. `song-rubber-stamp-regime` reports that AI
self-review gates enter a regime in which acceptance scores rise while benchmark
correctness falls. It is a preprint verified at abstract level, tier CONTESTED,
and it points the same direction as the rule already in [[The Firewall]]: the
model does not sign off on its own output.

What works instead on this surface is mechanical and cheap:

1. **Delete the first sentence** of the reply. If nothing was lost, it was an
   opener rather than an answer.
2. **Delete the last section.** If the reader can still act, the summary was
   repetition.
3. **Count the tool calls between a progress claim and the check that supports
   it.** If the answer is zero checks, the claim is unverified.
4. **Diff every summary of a tool result against the raw result.** Any assertion
   in the summary that is not in the result is a fabrication, not a compression.
5. **Invert every recommendation.** If the opposite recommendation would fit the
   surrounding text equally well, no recommendation was made. That is
   [[The Inversion Test]] applied to advice.
6. **Re-run the scanners after any repair**, and never accept "fixed" as a
   report without the re-run attached.

## The reflexive case

This vault was built by an agent, in a session, through exactly the kind of
transcript this note describes. That is not an aside. It is the strongest
available demonstration that the surface exists, and it constrains what this
note is allowed to claim.

Concretely, the build process produced instances of at least four rows above:
plan narration ahead of single-step edits, terminal summaries restating work the
reader had just watched happen, progress claims made before the verification
command ran, and over-structuring of short answers. The controls that caught
them were mechanical rather than introspective: `scripts/score_substance.py`
counting note-specific words, the long-dash grep, and the substance floors in
[[Note Conventions]].

The general principle is the one in [[Workslop]]. Work that transfers the
verification burden to the reader is not finished work, and an agent that says
"done" without the artifact has transferred it. The reflexive form is sharper:
a brain about padded output whose own build transcript was padded would have
demonstrated its thesis rather than refuted it, but it would still have wasted
the reader's time, and it is graded on that too.

## What is not a defect on this surface

- **Acknowledging a correction once.** The defect is the loop, not the first
  acknowledgement.
- **Structure on genuinely long output.** A twelve-section answer needs
  headings. A two-paragraph answer does not.
- **Restating an ambiguous request.** Disambiguation before work is cheaper than
  rework after it.
- **Uncertainty that is real.** Hedging a number nobody has measured is honest;
  see the unmeasured claims recorded in [[Sycophancy Evidence]].
- **Warmth.** The defect is affirmation that substitutes for a position, not
  courtesy that accompanies one.
- **Output that reads as machine-written.** No row here supports an authorship
  claim and none may be reported as one.
