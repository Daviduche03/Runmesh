# Why Detection Fails

The most cited fact in this folder is a withdrawal notice. On 2023-07-20 OpenAI
retired its own AI-text classifier, citing its low rate of accuracy. The
numbers it published for itself were 26 percent of AI-written text correctly
identified as likely AI-written, against 9 percent of human-written text
incorrectly labelled AI-written (`openai-classifier-withdrawal`). Those are a
vendor's figures for a vendor's own product, published by the vendor, and they
were bad enough that the vendor pulled the product. Nothing in the ledger since
has replaced that as the honest baseline expectation for origin classification
on arbitrary text.

This note is the entry point for the rest of `detection/`. It states the
structural case once, so that the other seven notes can each take one branch of
it without restating the whole argument.

## Three failures, not one

Origin detection is usually criticised as inaccurate. Inaccuracy is the least
interesting of its problems, because accuracy can improve. The three failures
below are properties of the approach, and improving a score does not remove any
of them.

**Failure 1: the output is a number with no reasoning attached.** A detector
returns a probability. It cannot name the sentence that convinced it, and it
cannot be argued with. Every downstream use, an academic misconduct hearing, an
editorial rejection, a code review, needs a reason rather than a score. See
[[Evidence Tiers]] for the tiering this brain uses instead, where every signal
carries its own citation and its own false-positive class.

**Failure 2: the errors land on identifiable people.** False positives are not
distributed at random. Stowe et al., peer reviewed at ACL 2026, ran 16 detection
models over student essays labelled for demographic attributes and found
English-language-learner essays disproportionately flagged, and non-White ELL
students disproportionately flagged relative to their White ELL peers
(`stowe-detector-bias`). This is the ethical core of the folder and it has its
own note: [[Detector Bias Against Language Learners]].

**Failure 3: the signal being measured may not be machine generation at all.**
Xu et al. report that Llama3-8B base-model continuations conditioned on human
prefixes received 98.8 percent human probability from Pangram, and conclude
that the tested detectors respond more to instruction-tuning artifacts and
local context than to an invariant property of machine generation
(`xu-base-models-look-human`, preprint v1). Their broader experiments show that
repeated rewriting can move detector scores, although outcomes vary by model,
detector, and text.

## The failure table

| Failure | Measured evidence | Ledger id | Continues in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low accuracy at source | 26 percent true positive, 9 percent false positive, withdrawn 2023-07-20 | `openai-classifier-withdrawal` | [[Human Expert Review]] |
| Errors fall on identifiable groups | 16 detection models, ELL essays disproportionately flagged | `stowe-detector-bias` | [[Detector Bias Against Language Learners]] |
| Older bias figure, small sample | 61.3 percent of TOEFL essays flagged, n equals 91 | `liang-gpt-detectors-biased` | [[Detector Bias Against Language Learners]] |
| Shifted by paraphrase | detector scores move across iterative paraphrase rounds, with varied outcomes | `xu-base-models-look-human` | [[Humanizers]] |
| Wrong signal measured | Llama3-8B base continuation with a human prefix rated 98.8 percent human by Pangram | `xu-base-models-look-human` | [[Model Fingerprints]] |
| Model judges do not agree with humans | GPT-5 kappa 0.01 against human slop labels | `shaib-measuring-slop` | [[Evidence Tiers]] |

The last row matters for a tempting workaround. If a classifier will not do the
job, the obvious next move is to ask a capable model directly. Shaib et al.
measured that agreement at kappa 0.01 for GPT-5, minus 0.01 for DeepSeek-V3,
and 0.03 for o3-mini, with models flagging at 0.03 to 0.08 against a human rate
of 0.34 (`shaib-measuring-slop`, preprint, abstract-level verification). Asking
the model is not a fallback. It is a worse instrument than the one that was
already withdrawn.

## What a positive result would have to survive

Before any origin signal could carry weight in a decision, it would need to
clear all five of the following. None of the tools in this folder clears them.

1. Name the specific spans that produced the score, so the claim can be checked.
2. Report a false-positive rate measured on the population being tested, not on
   a generic benchmark corpus.
3. Report that rate broken out by first language, since that is where the known
   disparity lives.
4. Hold up after one round of ordinary editing, which is indistinguishable from
   one round of paraphrase attack.
5. Distinguish machine generation from instruction-tuned register, which the
   base-model result above shows current detectors do not.

## What replaces it here

This brain routes every stylistic signal to a structural procedure that emits
an artifact, and it never emits a verdict about who or what wrote a text. The
routing rule is stated in [[The Firewall]] and the tier assignments live in
[[Evidence Tiers]]. Concretely, a suspicion about phrasing goes to
[[The Deletion Test]] or [[The Stranger Test]], a suspicion about sourcing goes
to [[The Attribution Test]], and a suspicion about a reference goes to
deterministic resolution rather than to a probability. Markers such as
[[The Em Dash|Em Dash Density]] and [[Excess Vocabulary]] are population-level signals, and
[[Marker Cohort Rot]] records why their diagnostic value decays.

The honest summary: detection is the wrong question, not merely a poorly
answered one. The right question is whether the artifact holds up, which is
answerable, checkable, and does not require anyone to be accused of anything.

## Confidence note

This note is tagged `practitioner` rather than `evidence-based` because two of
its five load-bearing sources, `xu-base-models-look-human` and
`shaib-measuring-slop`, are preprints verified at abstract level. The two
strongest claims, the OpenAI withdrawal figures and the Stowe bias result, are
independently high-confidence, and [[Detector Bias Against Language Learners]]
is tagged accordingly.
