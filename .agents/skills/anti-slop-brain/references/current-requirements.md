# Current Requirements

Status: researched. Last full verification pass 2026-07-27.

## Refresh Cadence

30 days for model-specific marker cohorts and detector claims. 90 days for
corpus studies and regulation. Before every release for any numeric claim.

## Required Source Standard

Use official, primary, vendor, standards-body, regulator, or API documentation
first. Record URL, retrieval date, version, deprecation or sunset notes, and
confidence. Every entry also carries an evidence tier so a vendor marketing
page can never be quoted as if it were a measured study.

Downgrade rules live in `references/source-ledger.json` under
`rules.downgrade_rules` and are applied on ingest, not at review time.

## Current Regulatory Position

The EU AI Act generally applies from 2026-08-02, including Article 50 subject
to its scope, exceptions, and transition. Generative systems already on the
market before that date have until 2026-12-02 for the Article 50(2)
machine-readable marking requirement. Article 99 permits fines up to 15
million euro or 3 percent of worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher,
with the lower applicable cap controlling for SMEs and eligible small mid-cap
enterprises. Source

consolidated EUR-Lex text, which is a documentation tool rather than the
authentic Official Journal act. These are enacted provisions and dates, not
individualized compliance guidance.

Wikipedia has prohibited LLM-generated or LLM-rewritten article content since
its RfC closed 2026-03-20 by 44 to 2 under SNOW. It is a content guideline,
not a policy, and it carries two exceptions: copyediting your own writing, and
LLM-assisted translation, both under mandatory human review. Source

## Open Requirements Not Yet Satisfied

1. No peer-reviewed study measures commercial humanizer output with human
   raters or counts introduced factual errors. Recorded as a gap.
2. The Nature Author Correction to shumailov-model-collapse could not be read
   behind the publisher auth wall, so its scope is unverified.
3. The Springer-walled independent evaluation of Pangram could not be read.
